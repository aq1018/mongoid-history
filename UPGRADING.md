## Upgrading Mongoid History

### Upgrading to 0.9.0

#### Inheritance of `track_history` configuration

Prior releases of Mongoid History would potentially apply a sub-classes's configuration
to its parent class and any additional sub-classes. This behavior has been corrected such
that a class and its sub-classes may have separate configurations.

Deployments that rely on the sub-classes's configuration applying to its parent
class and/or other sub-classes will need to migrate the configuration to the parent class.

See [#225](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-history/pull/225) for more information.

### Upgrading to 0.8.0

#### History is now tracked on create and destroy by default

By default, Mongoid History will now track all actions (create, update, and destroy.)
Previously, only update actions were tracked by default.

To preserve the old behavior, please modify your call to `track_history` as follows:

```ruby
  track_history ...
                track_create: false,
                track_destroy: false
```

See [#207](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-history/pull/207) for more information.

### Upgrading to 0.7.0

#### Remove history track when create, update or destroy raises an error

When an error is raised in a call to create, update or destroy a tracked model, any history track
created before the call will now be deleted. In the past this was a problem for associations marked
`dependent: :restrict`.

See [#202](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-history/pull/202) for more information.

# Main Changes / Upgrading Notes

See [#189](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-history/pull/189) for more information.

* Currently, the `:all` option behaves identically to `:fields`. Future versions will track all fields and relations of trackable class when using `:all`.

### Upgrading to 0.4.1

#### Migrate Userstamp

`Mongoid::History` no longer supports the userstamp natively. To track the User in the application who created the HistoryTracker, add the [Mongoid::Userstamp gem](https://github.com/tbpro/mongoid_userstamp) to your HistoryTracker class.

```ruby
class MyHistoryTracker
  include Mongoid::History::Tracker
  include Mongoid::Userstamp
end
```

Rename the field.

```ruby
MyHistoryTracker.all.rename(modifier_id: :created_by)
```
